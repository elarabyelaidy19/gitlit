# Gitlet 
Developed a lite version control system that mimics some of the basic features of the popular system git. 
Implemented the committing feature that saves the state of the Repository and restores previous versions with viewing the history. Maintained related sequences of commits in one separate branch and merging branches into another and resolving merge conflict.
